This is a prototype of a site to coordinate fleet deliveries.

There are a number of steps that need to occur to prepare a vehicle to be delivered to a fleet driver. This site uses mock data to simulate some of these scenarios. Ultimately, once all necessary steps are completed, this site allows the user to schedule a pickup or delivery of the vehicle. These appointments are tracked by dealership across all drivers, and the system prevents overlapping appointments.
